I have significantly enhanced Power BI's capabilities by developing a groundbreaking Proof of Concept
(POC) in Databricks, which overcomes the 32,767-character limitation and enables handling of an
unlimited number of characters. This innovation has been successfully implemented in a project,
allowing the system to now manage up to 65,000 characters, dramatically expanding its data handling
potential.
In another impactful Project in which i worked as a Databricks Developer, I automated multiple
processes, particularly focusing on data availability and refresh validation, resulting in a remarkable
annual time savings of 144 hours.Weâ€™ve boosted efficiency by automating flat file ingestion, input
schema validation, and availability checks, triggering downstream tasks seamlessly. Ticket creation for
the Nielsen team and improved data upload processes enhance workflow. ADF pipelines now trigger
automatically, while our Promo Dashboard refreshes after stakeholder validation. Output data validation
is automated against templates, ensuring accuracy. We also integrated a utility package into the SRM
France Pipeline, significantly elevating our data workflows ! And this has been implemented such that it
can be integrated into other markets too.
Currently, I am dedicated to a project as a Databricks Developer, where I efficiently apply advanced Data
Engineering techniques to facilitate seamless data visualization in Power BI. Through innovative
approaches and strategic automation, I ensure that the audit reporting data is structured, optimized, and
primed for dynamic visual representation, significantly enhancing Capitaland's reporting processes.
Additionally, I am leading an innovative POV on Celonis, aiming to leverage the transformative power of
process mining and data analytics to create a comprehensive solution that revolutionizes our approach
to operational efficiency. This project will delve into Celonisâ€™s capabilities to identify bottlenecks,
optimize workflows, and deliver actionable insights that can substantially enhance decision-making processes.
I have successfully developed sophisticated forms and workflows in ServiceNow, integrating approval
and rejection processes in multiple steps of approvals to streamline operations and enhance user
experience. Additionally, I have executed innovative Proof of Concepts (POCs) using Power Automate for
document verification on specific conditions and automating the sending of emails to improve
communication efficiency regarding the document. Furthermore, I have leveraged the Robot Framework
to create POCs focused on task automation, showcasing my commitment to optimizing processes and
driving operational excellence through technology.
I have also undergone training in Power Apps, which has empowered me to design and develop an
application specifically for Budget Tracking. This application streamlines financial processes, enhances
budget tracking, and provides users with intuitive tools to manage their finances effectively.
During this period, I have focused on key technologies such as Django, ReactJS, Azure, Databricks,
Celonis, and ServiceNow,Node.js,Power Automate. While Iâ€™ve gained valuable experience in these
areas, I am enthusiastic about the prospect of working with additional technologies to broaden my skill
set and enhance my contributions to future projects.
